Some notes on design choices, portability and ANSI conformance of alisp.



__Floating point arithmetic__

The four floating-point types of ANSI CL are all the same type and map to native
C double.  This is allowed by ANSI and was done for speed of implementation.  Of
course, it may change in the future.



__Type checking__

Arguments to standard functions and macros (or result of evaluating arguments,
when applicable) are all type checked.

Values assigned to standard variables (like *PACKAGE*, *READ-BASE* and so on)
are not type checked, so assigning an object of the wrong type will likely crash
the interpreter.

Currently, these behavior can't be changed.



__Stack overflows__

alisp makes no attempt to intercept stack overflows of lisp code; if your code
has an endless recursion, or a very high call depth, the interpreter will crash.

Ideally, al should only crash in these two cases: for a stack overflow in lisp
code, or after a wrong assignment to a standard variable (see "Type checking").



__Builtin macros__

Currently, al is non-conforming in this area.  Builtin macros are like special
operators: they are treated specially by the interpreter (which is allowed by
ANSI), but an alternate implementation of the macro in lisp is not provided
(which is requested by ANSI instead).
