al is a lisp implementation.  Right now it is just an interpreter, but
I will add some compilation later.  I aim for Common Lisp conformance,
but I'm not religious about it.


Currently it depends on GNU Readline and on GNU Multiple Precision
Arithmetic Library.  It uses autotools for building.


To build, start with

  $ autoreconf -fi

and then run the usual

  $ ./configure

  $ make
